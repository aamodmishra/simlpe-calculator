# simlpe-calculator
a simple calculator using js 
actually this is not calculator ,like you think its a basic to add and sub using 
js and using inner html document to display the calculated value 
.......
you cannot add other value it has own digit for calculation 
...
i will crate an updated calculator where you can directly choose digits to perform calculation .
